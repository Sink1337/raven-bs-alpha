@everyone 📢 RavenBS Takedown Notice — Read Carefully

RavenBS has been officially taken down by Chefess for copyright violations.
We strongly advise all users not to associate with RavenBS. Stick to real clients like Raven B4 & Myau, which are professionally maintained, secure, and legally distributed.

 What is RavenBS?
RavenBS is a skidded and unauthorized client based on decompiled, deobfuscated, and remapped code from Raven B4 Update 2. It is a direct infringement of our proprietary software.

---

📜 Official Statement:
“I am the [private] and [private] of the proprietary software Raven B4. I am submitting this takedown on behalf of my organization, which distributes this software commercially.”

Raven B4 is a paid, closed-source Minecraft client originally developed by [private] and actively maintained. It includes features such as:
• Automation modules
• Visual enhancements
• Performance utilities

Raven B4 has never been open-source and is distributed exclusively through our [private] server to verified license holders.

🚫 About the Violation:
A third-party repository hosted at:
https://github.com/Strangerrrs/Raven-bS
has openly admitted using decompiled Raven B4 source code:

“Raven B4, but for those who can't afford it, or too paranoid to get it… based off b3, with the help of b4 src.”

Even their Discord FAQ confirms:
“b4 src refers to decompiled, deobfuscated, and remapped Raven B4 Update 2 code.”

This is a blatant admission of copyright violation.
The structure, features, and naming conventions are copied directly from Raven B4.

⚠️ Final Reminder:
RavenBS is not safe, not supported, and not legal.
All users are encouraged to report any unauthorized forks or leaks.
For access to the real Raven B4, refer to our official [private] channel or Discord server.
